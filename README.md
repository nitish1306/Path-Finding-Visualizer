# Path Finding Visualizer!

This Site is visualizes and solves different mazes using different algorithm for any given input state.<br />
Observe and learn better on how each algorithm functions!<br /><br />
Check out the website: https://nitish1306.github.io/path-finding-visualizer/.
<br />

## How each algorithm works?
### Dijkstra's Algorithm: <br />
This Algorithm simply explores the node which is closer to the starting point, in an unweighted grid it simply works like bfs.<br />
**Guarantees Shortest Path**. <br /> 

### Greedy-Best First Search: <br />
This Algorithm simply explores the node which is closer to the End point. <br />
**Does'nt Guarantee Shortest Path**. <br />

### A-star Algorithm: <br />
This Algorithm's Heuristic (or logic) is the sum/cost so far from starting node plus the distance to end point, this heuristic makes the algorithm work "smartly".<br />
**Guarantees Shortest Path**. <br />


## Features:
* Can Freely move the start and end point.
* Can Add/remove Walls either by click or press-dragging the mouse.
* Can adjust speed of animation.
* Can change the directions of exploring nodes.
*	Dark theme for all Night- Owls out there!

## All buttons:
* Choose whether to include Diagonal moves or no.
* Toggle the speed of animation.
* 3 Main Search algorithms: Dijkstra, Greedy-Best First search and A-Star algorithm.
* Reset Board: Resets whole board to initial state.
* Clear: Clears all colored nodes( Visited, Explored and Path Nodes).

## Upcoming Features:
* Random Maze Generating Button.
* Buttons design.
* More appealing colors for Dark theme.
* More search algorithms.
* Weighted Nodes feature.
